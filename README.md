 React Application which displays talks that can be rated and added to personal schedule.

## Getting Started

Below are the instructions to get the application running on your machine. 

### Prerequisites

Before running this application you will need to install the dependences via NPM. This will require Node on your machine (link to site found in "Built With" section). Below are the steps to install the necessary dependencies. 

NOTE - Recommended to open the application folder in VS Code and use the build in terminal to run these commands.

1. Install dependencies for the server side of the application.

```
npm install
```

2. Install the dependencies for the client side of the application.

```
cd client && npm install
```

3. Return to the route folder.

```

```

NOTE - Some of the dependencies may become outdated and require updates. This can be done via the following command (use this command both in the root folder and client folder as required.)

This may result in breakage of the application so please have a backup incase.

```
npm update
```


### Running the Application

Run the server and client concurrently (from the root folder).

```
npm run dev
```
